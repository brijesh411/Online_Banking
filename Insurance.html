            Insurance fraud is another type of financial fraud that involves some
            sort of trickery or deception committed throughout any point of the
            claim process by a claimant, healthcare provider, employee in the insurance
            company or even agents and brokers (Ngai et al., 2011). The
            primary industries targeted by fraudulent insurance claims are the
            healthcare and automobile insurance industry; however, crop and home
            insurance fraud also occurs, although there is a lack of literature on both
            (Abdallah et al., 2016). It is estimated that the total cost of insurance
            fraud in the US exceeds $80 billion annually and is ultimately passed on
            to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums (Bureau, 2011).        </p>

            Of all the different types of fraud that fall under this category,
            automobile insurance fraud detection has attracted the most attention
            (Ngai et al., 2011). According to a study conducted on behalf of the
            Insurance Bureau of Canada by KPMG, an international accounting organization,
            the cost of fraudulent auto-insurance claims in the Canadian
            province of Ontario exceeded $1.6 billion in the year 2012 (KPMG,
            2012). Furthermore, elements of suspected fraud have been reportedly
            found in 21% to 36% of automobile insurance claims, and less than 3%
            of those suspected fraudulent claims end up being prosecuted (Derrig,
            2002; Viaene, Derrig, Baesens, & Dedene, 2002).        </p>

            Automobile insurance claims generally involve a contract between
            the insurance company and the insured individual or organization to
            cover the relevant costs of theft or accidental damage of a vehicle.
            Fraudulent claims can be perpetrated by individual fraudsters; one way
            this is achieved is by means of deception during the claim process. Evidence
            also exists of organized groups collaborating together to commit
            insurance fraud, usually by staging or faking accidents, where in some
            cases an accident may not have even occurred; instead, the vehicles were
            transported to the scene (ˇSubelj, Furlan, & Bajec, 2011). Regardless,
            most fraudulent cases are opportunistic frauds in that they are not
            planned, and instead, the opportunity arising from an accident is seized
            by an individual by exaggerating the damages or statements made in a
            claim (ˇSubelj et al., 2011). Some of the schemes involved in automobile
            insurance fraud have been identified and defined by the ACFE.        </p>

            In modern society, healthcare has become a significant concern that
            is tangled with political, social, and economic issues. The public demand
            for high-quality medical services and the technology necessary to provide
            them is met with a substantial financial cost. Also, the availability
            of government-sponsored healthcare insurance systems is critical for
            many low-income individuals and families depending on them for support
            to pay for the continually increasing costs of drugs and treatment
            (Yang & Hwang, 2006). A growing problem has been the abuse and
            exploitation of healthcare insurance systems by fraudsters for benefits
            they or someone else may not be entitled to. Healthcare providers have
            also been found to exploit the system for financial gain through practices
            inconsistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices. This results
            in unnecessary costs or reimbursements for services not medically
            necessary or that fail to adhere to professionally recognized standards for healthcare (Yang & Hwang, 2006). It has been reported by the National
            Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) that the total losses
            due to fraudulent healthcare insurance claims in the United States are
            estimated, conservatively, to have exceeded $100 billion in 2018,
            approximately 3% of the total expenditure on healthcare that year
            which was $3.6 trillion (Association, 2018). However, some government
            and law enforcement agencies estimate the losses to reach as high as 360
            $ billion. Sparrow (Sparrow, 2000) was among the first to classify the
            various types of fraudster behaviours in healthcare insurance into two
            categories: “hit-and-run” or “steal a little, all the time.” With “hit-andrun”
            fraudsters, they simply submit as many fraudulent claims as
            possible, disappearing shortly after receiving payment for them.
            Fraudsters who “steal a little, all the time” try to ensure their actions go
            undetected so that they can continually make fraudulent claims or
            billings over long periods of time.        </p>

            Traditionally, detecting fraudulent insurance claims relied heavily
            on manual auditing and inspection by experts in the field, which can be
            costly and inefficient, especially since these types of claims must be
            detected before they are paid out. As a result of this time sensitivity, the
            recognition and attention gained by techniques that fall under the umbrella
            of machine learning and data mining for detecting insurance fraud
            have been steadily increasing in recent years. With the constant research
            and developments in computational capacity and power, these types of
            techniques demonstrate the potential to detect fraudulent cases in much
            less time and possibly greater accuracy than manual inspection, subsequently
            resulting in significantly reduced financial losses. This ultimately
            translates to a decrease in costs and overall greater potential
            profits.        </p>
