            Another type of fraud encountered in the financial domain is securities
            & commodities fraud. This type of fraud can involve a variety of
            different schemes, the FBI describing some as pyramid schemes, Ponzi
            schemes, prime bank schemes, high yield investment fraud, advance fee
            fraud, hedge fund fraud, commodities fraud, foreign exchange fraud,
            market manipulation, broker embezzlement and late-day trading (Bureau,
            2011). With the continuing integration of capital markets, unprecedented
            opportunities have been created for businesses to raise or
            access capital and for investors to diversify their portfolios. The
            increased opportunities also come with a commensurate rise in fraud
            risk, as such driving the need for research to detect these types of frauds.        </p>

            Mortgage fraud is defined by the FBI as a material misstatement,
            misrepresentation or omission by a debtor at any point of the process in
            which the information is relied upon by an underwriter or lender to
            obtain a loan (Bureau, 2011). Furthermore, corporate fraud involves the
            falsification of financial information, self-dealing by corporate insiders
            or obstruction of justice designed to conceal any of these types of
            criminal conducts. Finally, mass marketing fraud is a general term for
            crimes exploiting mass-communications media (Bureau, 2011).        </p>
