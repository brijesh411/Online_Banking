            The process used by criminal or terrorist individuals and organizations
            to legitimize or “clean” the proceeds of their crimes and disguise
            their origins is known as money laundering. These crimes are often
            linked with organized crime syndicates, drug trafficking, sex trafficking,
            and the financing of terrorists (West & Bhattacharya, 2016). Money
            laundering is a global problem that incurs significant costs to the world
            economy due to its destructive effects on national economies. Furthermore,
            it can jeopardize the stability of and increase the operational risk
            of financial institutions as money laundering often motivates and fosters
            corruption in both the public and private sectors (Schott, 2004).        </p>

            This
            makes countries rampant with money laundering and corruption less
            attractive to foreign investors, perpetuating the cycle of inequality faced
            by their citizens (Schott, 2004).        </p>

            Behavioural patterns of money laundering activity and structural
            network features are essential to anti-money laundering research.
            However, traditional research has focused on legislative considerations
            and compliance requirements and has been methodologically limited to
            incident identification, avoidance detection and suspicion surveillance
            (Gao & Ye, 2007). Thus, investigations are generally performed manually,
            which is time-consuming, resource-intensive, tedious. Therefore,
            applying anomaly detection techniques may reduce the time to process
            the voluminous datasets associated with these crimes and even lead to
            improvements in detection effectiveness and decrease false alarm rates
            (Gao & Ye, 2007). We note, however, a general lack of available literature
            studying applying anomaly detection techniques to anti-money
            laundering in published literature.        </p>
