            The widespread use of credit cards as the primary method of transacting is a striking example of the digitalization of everyday life and society over the past couple of decades. This adoption also presents the problem of credit card fraud, which involves sophisticated strategies and techniques employed for the theft of money and assets. According to (Report, 2020), card transactions' fraudulent losses reached $28.65 billion in 2020, with the US accounting for a third of that gross loss with $9.62 billion. As credit cards gain popularity and their use is becoming even more prevalent, there is also a concern about the increase in fraudulent efforts (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011). There are significant ramifications associated with undetected credit card fraud, as the crimes have even been exploited for funding organized crime, narcotics trafficking and even financing terrorists (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011).

            There are two ways of classifying credit card fraud, either as application or behavioural fraud, which are sometimes also referred to as offline and online fraud, respectively (Kou, Lu, Sirwongwattana, & Huang, 2004; Bolton & Hand, 2001). Application fraud is often associated with identity fraud, as it usually involves fraudsters attempting to issue new cards from credit companies using other peoples private information. Behavioural fraud is comprised of four different acts, which involve mail theft, stolen or lost cards, counterfeit cards, cardholder not present fraud or bankruptcy fraud (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011; Bolton & Hand, 2001). Mail theft fraud primarily involves fraudsters intercepting other peoples mail to obtain physical credit cards or personal banking information, which they then use to commit application fraud. Stolen or lost credit card related fraud typically occurs when physical cards are stolen from individuals either with or without their knowledge or when fraudsters find or gain access to lost cards. Bankruptcy fraud is considered one of the most challenging types of fraud to detect and generally entails people using a credit card with no intention of ever paying back the balance and then filing for personal bankruptcy, as defined by Ghosh and Reilly in 1994 (Ghosh & Reilly, 1994).

            With the rapid digitization of everyday life, more information is available online that is subsequently vulnerable to attack or exploitation by criminals and fraudsters. Fraudsters rely on these vulnerabilities to obtain credit card information through illegal means, which they could then implement into a fake or counterfeit card. All the mentioned methods can also be involved in cardholder not present frauds, which only require the credit card details to conduct transactions remotely, such as by mail, phone, or the Internet. There are many ways that the information necessary to commit these types of fraudulent acts is obtained, like online phishing scams to trick unaware individuals, or by intrusions of companys networks and computer systems, or even by physical devices known as skimmers installed on the card readers of tampered ATMs to steal peoples card information (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011; Quah & Sriganesh, 2008).

            Most credit card fraud detection strategies involve creating a profiler for cardholders by analyzing individual spending behaviours and patterns (Abdallah, Maarof, & Zainal, 2016). Chandola et al. classify profile-based approaches into two types: either a “by-owner” approach or a “by-operation” approach (Chandola et al., 2009). The “by-owner” approach profiles each credit card user based on their usage and spending history, comparing new transactions to the user’s profile and flagging the ones inconsistent from the profile as anomalies.

            The disadvantage of this approach is that it is typically costly as it requires a central data repository, which must be queried every time a user makes a transaction (Chandola et al., 2009). “By-operation” approaches detect fraudulent transactions from transactions occurring at specific geographic locations that are unlikely to be frequented by the genuine cardholder. The type of anomaly detected by both approaches are contextual anomalies, the contexts being the user for “by-owner” approaches and the geographic location for “by-operation” approaches. When constructing fraud detection systems or models using credit card datasets, the samples of transactions are described by an initial set of raw features that describe or depict information about each sample. From the inspection of the surveyed literature, it has been apparent that regardless of the study, the raw features describing datasets are often quite similar. After investigation, it has been found this is due to standards set by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) foundation that govern and regulate financial reporting practices that credit card issuers and financial institutions must adhere to (Institute, 2011).
